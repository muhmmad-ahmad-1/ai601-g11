"You guys need to cherish your WFH life, I got RTO’d and I’ve never been more miserable in my life ","I’m angry all the time now, everyone is noticing it. I try not to be but I’m just so irritated at everything and everyone because of the fact I’m driving 1.5 hour to sit in and office when I could do the same thing at home and save a lot of money and time. Needless to say, I’m looking for something new and I hope I can get something. If I can’t find something by February/March I’m going to try and get into the police academy. Office life is not for me, my brain is melting slowly each day while there. I give on word responses to everyone there and I don’t engage in any convos (most got the hint and don’t talk to me at all anymore which is awesome because I dont like or care for them)  , I do what i need and then leave. I love my family so much so on my drive home I really try and get my anger out so I am not rude to my family because its not fair to them. ",ZadarskiDrake,2024-12-05 12:14:09,10653,remotework

"I interviewed, accepted, and signed contract for a remote role. First day and they’re asking me to come into the office once a week. What do I do?","I’ve already reiterated to them that this was presented as a remote role to me and they explicitly said they know that the role was presented as remote but they want me to come in once a week. I said no, and they said they’d “check if it’s okay.” I left a full time permanent job for this contract. I told my recruiting company and they are absolutely flabbergasted and disgusted, said they’re going to talk to the manager about it. They hired another woman in the same position who started at the same time as me, we are all in other states but because I’m an hour and a half away from the headquarters I’m the only one they’re asking to come in. Is this legal? I never would have left my last job if I knew this!

Update: Wow, this blew up! Thank you everyone for all of your advice. I spoke with my manager today, it sounds like upper management kind of bamboozled both her and the recruiters telling them it could be remote and then walking back on it once they saw my address was closer. The plan is I will come in once a month for a team meeting if I’m able but that that is totally flexible and based on my availability, and I don’t have to arrive until the time of the team meeting to avoid Philly traffic. My recruiters were ready to fight for me and so was my boss because they were just as shocked and upset as I was. Everything is all good now!",bee_antlers,2025-01-06 23:33:45,6395,remotework

Oh how offices have changed,"For those who don't know,  20-30 years ago,  commuting into the office meant:

You had your own desk and chair ( no flexidesking).

You often got your own office.  With a door so you could focus on those important tasks.

You often got a company car for your commute.  At the very least heavily subsidised public transport.

Offices with soundproofing ( they even had ceiling panels).  So no need for headphones.

You even had a carpark allocated so you didn't have to pay for parking.

You were paid enough to buy a home within 30 minutes of where you worked.

Occasional work dinners with taxi fares paid for to get home safely.

So the next time someone who is retired  tells you to suck it up.  Remind them about how companies have turned these work environments into hellholes for many people.

Edit: typos

Edit2:  woke up and there are heaps of comments.  Good to see discussion.  As some people have asked for some clarification.  Yes,  I have experienced all of this since entering the professional workforce in the early 1990s.  I have seen the degradation from offices through to cubeville,  chicken coups,  open plan,  flexidesking etc.  The post is pureky about the changes to physical work environments - there were some things that were better in the long long ago and some things were definitely worse ( physical work environments being one - at least for me).

RTO is the new war on the middle class,"It seemed that the middle class finally found a way to afford a living.  Remote work allowed us to move to less congested and less expensive locations, while still be able to find a livable wage.  We could actually have a decent life, raise a family, and we could even make it work on one income.  We finally broke free from the dystopian urban centers that the upper class had us locked in.  But they can never have enough.  Everyone must suffer in order to serve them.  Now they want us back to modern day slavery.  Next will be corporate housing because none of us will afford to live in those horrendous downtowns.  Well, I am not going back, unless I am desperate, and only temporarily.  The economy will get better.  They will be competing for our labor again soon.

Spread the word","Staying at your RTO job and being an incompetent employee will cost the company more money than simply resigning. Resigning is what they want to lay you off so they save money. Instead, you want to stay on the company’s payroll for as long as possible while doing as bad of a job as possible that they’ll regret RTO. Also, get your coworkers to do this. Your manager will drag you into his office for “a talk” and will probably write you up. Don’t let this deter you, it’s just a part of the process; remember they’re going to fire you anyways (there’s a recession coming up, plus AI is slowly taking over jobs).

RTO = treating us like children,"I was hired on hybrid (2 days remote, 3 days in office) with the option to work from home when I, as the NCP, had my tween on school vacations. 

RTO began Monday, and it is a shitshow. There is already a debate over whether working through lunch and eating at your desk counts toward the eight hour workday. 

There is also a strong likelihood that remote work during school vacations will no longer be an option. Here’s the thing: a summer program for my young teen is not an option. Full stop. Leaving said young teen at home alone for 10 hours (8 hours plus commute) is also not an option. I can leave the young teen alone to come in for a few hours, but not all day. 

This is a shitshow, they’re treating us like children, and I’m currently searching for a new, fully remote job. ",dollar15,2025-01-08 16:55:03,2663,remotework

Forced back to Office just to get fired,"Just wanted to share a quick story.

I was working remotely from abroad, and the company suddenly asked all the remote employees to start showing back to the office within a week. 

Now the main issue was that I was the only one working from abroad and I was halfway across the globe. Logistically it was not feasible to just book a flight and come back within a week as flights were super expensive and I had made arrangements for accomodation. On top of that I had a vacation planned in three weeks so going back home and then flying back just didn't make sense.

After some emails back and forth and arguing about it I was told that I had to be in the office by next week or there would be consequences. I complied, went to the office. They set up an HR meeting with me and fired me telling me some BS about how I was pushing it by not following HR policies and started digging up issues from a year ago stating that we are misaligned.

So yeah, I was forced back to the office just to get fired. But hey at least I got 2 months worth of salary as compensation.

Husband had been having medical issues and asked for an ADA accommodation so he could be 100% remote (it was a good medical reason too). He was denied. 

He's currently on sick leave and is actually doing much better. But one day he got a call from a head hunter, who recruited him for a 100% remote job with better pay. I asked if he was going to give his bosses an opportunity to counter-offer. His response: ""Fuck no. Fuck them.""

"Remote Employee for 7 Years, Now Forced to Commute Because of Coworker’s Complaint","I’ve been a remote employee for 7 years, long before the pandemic. My job was explicitly hired as remote, and I live 3 hours away from the office. Commuting 6 hours a day is impossible, especially since I have a 6-month-old baby at home.

Recently, the CEO announced a mandatory 4-day in office work week for hybrid employees. Initially, I didn’t think this applied to me, but then I found out that I now have to come in 3 days a week. The reason? A coworker who was hybrid and chose to relocate near me complained to management that it’s unfair he has to commute when I get to stay remote.

I feel like I’m being penalized for someone else’s decision. My coworker is younger, single, and has no family obligations. I on the other hand, built my entire life around being remote. I’ve been productive and successful in this role for years, but now I’m being forced into a situation that feels unsustainable.

RTO thoughts from HR ,"I work in HR and wanted to share some thoughts on remote work, RTO policies, and what the future might hold.

First off, I know HR often gets blamed for enforcing RTO, but trust me, we don’t want to go back to the office either. The push comes from senior leadership, and unfortunately, it’s our job to implement it. But we dislike it just as much as everyone else, if not more, because we see firsthand how problematic it can be.

During the pandemic, when everyone was working from home, leadership frequently reminded us that we’d return to the office once it was safe. However, as the job market shifted in favor of employees, many people started quitting, citing the desire to remain remote during exit interviews. This wasn’t a small number. Entire teams were dismantled, and filling roles took forever because candidates were clear that remote work was non-negotiable. To combat this attrition and attract talent faster, leadership had no choice but to adjust their stance and embrace remote work as a permanent option.

But by 2024, as the job market turned back in favor of employers, they flipped the script again and announced RTO.

I believe these companies are setting themselves up for a rude awakening when the job market shifts back toward employees. The mass exodus they experienced before, and their struggle to fill positions due to a lack of flexible work options, will leave them with no choice but to adjust their stance again.

In the long run, I don’t see RTO lasting. Employees have experienced the benefits of remote work, and once the job market shifts again, I expect smart companies will leverage remote work to attract top talent. Meanwhile, those that stick with rigid RTO policies may find themselves falling behind.",Any_Conference550,2025-01-16 04:19:39,1947,remotework
"If you want RTO because of productivity, then that's the only time you will have it","During the pandemic, many companies experienced increased or even record profits while employees worked from home. Yet now, despite those results, there seems to be a renewed push for a return to the office, with productivity being cited as the reason.

If being in the office is the key to productivity, then we should align our efforts accordingly. This means reserving all work strictly for office hours and locations. There would be no need for company-issued laptops or mobile devices if our productivity is indeed tied to the physical office space. 

If an issue arises after 5 PM, it will have to wait until the next business day. My personal time, whether spent relaxing or tending to personal obligations, is just that—personal. Similarly, weekend emergencies can be addressed when I am back in the office on Monday. Given the belief that working from home diminishes productivity, it is only fair to ensure that my contributions are at their peak (and sober) during office hours.",,2024-10-08 10:18:55,1902,remotework

RTO is the loudest admission that offices are a complete failure,"RTO mandates are the clearest proof that the office system has failed. If the office worked, companies wouldn’t need to force anyone back. People would naturally see it as the best place to do their work. Instead, RTO shows that employees don’t believe in the office as a productive environment. Many see it as a waste of time and personal resources.

Efforts to rebuild “office culture” miss the point. The office can’t deliver what it once did because the world has changed. Everything has shifted in terms of how people think, work, and value their time. The 2019 version of office culture is dead, and the people being called back simply aren’t the same as before. Trying to recreate the old way is not very different from trying to rebuild a house on a cracked foundation.

Companies that recognize this and adapt will absolutely thrive.

And in both cases, no one knows if there will be room for anyone. For Monday, there’s already word that folding tables and chairs will be on hand. And that still may not be enough, especially since many federal agencies, DOD included, have offloaded unused office space.

Now imagine the distant remote folks, many are hundreds of miles from where they would go to the office. Imagine not being told anything until the last minute, having next to no time to pack up your family, and that presumes they can move.

Hopefully sanity will return and people can go back to remote. But it is going to suck for the next few years.

The real reason bosses hate remote work.,"After the remote work experiment, many bosses went nuts and shared videos about employees not working at all but playing video games and doing laundry.

The thing is, what actually happen is that remote work showed off the bad planning of the company.  
And most of that bad planning is actually a result of ""office politics"".  
So, by not being in an office, there is no ""politics"", hence, the only thing you can measure is output.  
But, as you can imagine, most of the time we used to spend in the office was playing ""office politics"" and spending time on stupid things to be perceived as ""hardworking"".   
And, once we went remote, employees realize they could finish their assignments is about half of the time.  
So, many went for a second or a third job, which didn´t affect the performance of any, an the proof is most managers never suspect anything about it.   
In a nutshell, what is actually happening is the job market is shifting towards the gig economy and the uberization of gig works.  
And that implies most middle management is useless, as well as the giant real estate most companies own.  
This shit could break drown the whole thing, destroying the system because it would lead to mass white-collar layoffs.   
An that is the thing, corporate America is degrading, the system is being corrupted, so corrupted it is no longer the same anymore, it would be a new system: the sharing economy.",JuggernautBulky1008,2024-08-18 17:52:06,1712,remotework

Remote job RTO’d and I’m all by myself in the office. So much for collaboration. 🙄,"Rant incoming. 

I work for a large-ish financial firm and was remote from 2020 until this past November. My team was required to RTO 2-3 days per week which I really didn’t have a problem with because I live so close to the office.

Two of my teammates live in a different state and report into that office with my manager, three are fully remote because they don’t live within commutable distance to any office, and two would be reporting into my office with me. My first day in office I was told my two local teammates requested/received accommodations to stay remote so I have been by myself in the office since November.

All my meetings are still on teams/webex, I talk to maybe one person when I’m in the office, while my team is sitting at home bullshitting in the teams group chat.

Just found out company installed software that takes screenshots of open windows and records them every 90 seconds...,"This gives me so much anxiety. I work hybrid, 2 days from home for a small company. There have been periods where work is slow and I use a mouse mover, or have an easy day and schedule fake meetings with myself where I just sit in a teams meeting so it shows as ""in a call"" to look busy. From what I've heard they take screenshots every 90 secs and then the software compares windows up/activity and can report on it. I'm hoping they only use this stuff when they are suspicious but I can't help but get crazy anxiety from this. I guess chances are I would have been reprimanded by now if they were actively monitoring me, and I have delivered some high impact projects. But at the same time if I have a lull I would like the option to take it easy every now and then! Anyone else deal with software like this?

WFH job would require me to be on camera all day ,"Recently interviewed for a position with a small healthcare company that requires their employees to log into a Zoom meeting with their teammates for the entire day. Reasoning is to collaborate, ask questions, etc. I am a former remote worker for years prior to the pandemic who worked for a large company that never or rarely had to be on camera during meetings only. Our production was captured from reports. My question is…why on earth would a company require employees to be on camera all day?

Mark my words: a WFH wave will come to the US. It'll be BIG.,"No matter what reasons the CEOs have for mandating RTO, remote work will win the war.

As office space leases come up for renewal, many will simply expire and those expiring tenants will move to WFH. Maybe companies that own their office space will also see a cost savings, sell the office(s), and transition to WFH.

Not only that, but the tide is turning in the employee's favor with the Fed starting to decrease interest rates.

All this means more remote jobs opening up, and as they do, the office mandate companies will go to full-time WFH or else find themselves running on a skeleton crew, or worse. Like, a tech company with an office mandate could find themselves with no tech workers.

It'll be one bigass wave.

You need to actually be good at something to get a remote job,"Can we please ban the style of post that is “I have zero work experience but I want to work remote”? 

No, you won’t find anything. Remote work has become rare and everyone wants a remote job. Even customer service jobs require work experience. Employers are taking the best of the best because they can. Insanely skilled workers aren’t getting remote jobs. Remote jobs have hundreds or even thousands of applicants. FAANG companies are firing people in droves who have entered the job market; what makes you think someone would pick your empty resume for a job over someone from Google?

Data entry jobs are scams, if you are a “personal assistant” type you likely are not finding anything, if you just graduated, you likely won’t pick up a remote job, if you have no specific skills you likely won’t be able to find a remote job. Take any job you can get, work for 3 to 5 years and get really good and you could get a remote job. OR wait for an employee friendly economy again where everyone is remote, but I wouldn’t push my luck. Maybe if you are besties with a hiring manager. 

TLDR- if you are unskilled, develop a skill. Then come look for a remote job.

EDIT- I want to be clear that I do have a lot of empathy for folks who are looking for their big break. The world has changed a lot. It used to be you could work your way up from the bottom in an entry level job and be successful, no matter what. Workers are being treated like shit. Remote work is getting harder to find. Even just five years ago, I knew folks that have never had a tech job in their life pick something up and finding success. I wish the world was like that again, but it’s not, at least not now.

The most powerful life hacks I've discovered for Remote work,"I’ve started working remotely with COVID and it's now a lifestyle many of us have embraced forever. But with the freedom of a home office comes unique challenges—staying productive, maintaining work-life balance, and navigating the nuances of virtual communication, just to name a few. Here are some life hacks I found very valuable for myself to find a good balance working remotely.

**Get Outside**

Just 15 minutes out in the sun can help set your circadian rhythm, fire up your metabolism, and get your brain into high gear.

**2-3 hours work out of your home-set up to enter flow**

Contrary to popular belief, remote work doesn't confine you to your home. I've found that a change of scenery can do wonders for entering a state of flow. I start the workday at home, and when I notice a dip in productivity, I relocate to a nearby café for a focused 2-3 hour work session. This shift not only rejuvenates my creative juices but also acts as a mental 'reset,' helping me tackle tasks with renewed vigor.

**Meditate, even if it is 10 mins.**

If we can't chill alone for 10 mins without checking our phones, we've got a big problem. Meditation is like the mental gym. You're training your brain to slow down, focus, and just *be.* I swear, it's like rebooting your brain.

If you start by your own you’ll be overwhelmed; look on Youtube for “guided meditation” (you can find 5, 10, 15 and more videos depending on how you want to start). Also **Headpace** or **calm** have beginner guides usually for free.

**Say Thanks, Feel Better**

I've started jotting down five things I'm grateful for every day. Sounds simple, but does it change the game. When you focus on what you're thankful for, it's like you're hardwiring your brain to be happier. I'm talking better mood, stronger friendships, and even better health.

**Write it Out**

Very similar to the previous one, I've found that jotting down my thoughts every day is crazy beneficial. It's like I'm decluttering my brain. Plus, my communication skills have gone up a notch. You're going to need that, especially if you're aiming for success in today's world. There are also tons of apps for making journaling more enjoyable, like **Dayone, Diarium, Penzu**... Many of them are free.

**Get a Wise Council**

The most successful people have mentors or a coach. Imagine getting life advice from someone who's already walked the path you're on. It's like life-hacking with cheat codes. The impact of this can't be overstated. So, seek out someone who's a few steps ahead of you in the game and absorb their wisdom like a sponge. Now with AI there are also some AI coaches that are a great way to start, because coaching is all about asking yourself the right question. **Wave coaching** is a good one.

**Self-Care Isn't Selfish**

We're so busy grinding away for someone else that we forget to invest in the most important project: ourselves. Take 30 minutes daily to read, work out, or learn something new. Think of it as a non-negotiable meeting with yourself.

**Read, really read**

You'd be surprised how few people actually read regularly. Set aside some time to dive into a book—any book—that piques your interest. It's like compound interest for your brain.

**Cold shower in the morning**

This might sound nuts, but taking a 3-minute cold shower gives you this weird boost for the whole day. It’s like you're shocking your body into beast mode. Seriously, try it.

**Bed time alarm**

Don't underestimate the power of a good night's sleep. Set an alarm to remind you to start winding down. Ditch the tech, maybe read something light, and just chill. You're setting the stage for a killer day ahead.

Let me know if you have any other habits I should add to the post",Omeet2,2023-10-17 12:04:46,1225,remotework
RTO is a f*cking joke,"I don't buy that 5 day RTO will improve collaboration or any performance metrics. In fact I expect productivity to get worse. Here's why:

*Increased commute*

This one is probably the most obvious, but with thr average commute times being around 30 mins, that's an extra hour of your day gone. It's hard to give your best when you're 1) tired from commuting 2) feeling worn down because you have less time in the day to attend to personal life

That's not even considering the extra fuel needed to commute more, putting more financial pressure on employees in an already difficult economy

*Familiarity breeds contempt*

I've worked fully remote, fully in office and hybrid. In my opinion, hybrid is the sweet spot where you continue to manage social relationships with your coworkers which is very useful for productivity. However, seeing/having lunch with your coworkers after a few days a week gets old and annoying. More time spent together also means more chances to get tired of the little annoying things they might do. Like a dripping faucet. Hybrid allowed a nice reset so I felt ready for interaction again

*More hassle*

Prompting everyone to return means more struggle to find parking, more traffic, more accidents (I've seen an unreal amount of them the past couple weeks). 

Meal prepping for the entire week lest you have to eat out and spend unnecessary money. I know this is what they want, but it's frustrating nonetheless


*Less privacy/deep thought*

In office is okay when trying to purely execute on a task from muscle memory but for those who require quiet for deep concentration, it's not the place, especially for an open floorplan office. 

Additionally, coworkers will sometimes interrupt when you're in a flow state which really hurts overall productivity

When I worked fully remotely, I ended up getting promoted off of working 5-6 hour days because I was so much more productive working at home alone. 

*Additional factors*

More likely to get sick. It's winter and everyone is sick. They advise to stay home when sick but I honestly think it'd a badge of honor/dedication in the US to show up even when sick...I don't get it

*Worse for the environment*

It's the in thing for companies to claim they're sustainable or going green these days, but unecessarily forcing people to commute in more often completely opposes that. 

*Meetings are a huge waste of time*

There is this culture of forced delinquency in meetings where you may or may not be needed, but you may sit in a 90 min meeting and only spent 5 mins talking. That time could be used for mindless tasks like packing the dishwasher or folding clothes while still listening and contributing when necessary 

All in all, 5 day RTO seems completely unnecessary for people who can do their jobs remotely and it's infuriating to be micromanaged like this as an adult. As long as my semi annual reviews are good, who cares how often I'm in the office?

Everyone should actively apply and interview for onsite jobs to waste their time,"So far this year, I've interview for 6 hybrid roles. 3 days in-office. A couple were a 45 minute best case drive, 1 hr 15 min drive during weekday normal hours. One involved a tollway, bridge, and was 1hr 45 min estimated per Google Maps when I checked at peak commute hours (but only 42 minutes when looking at 4AM on a weekend)

I didn't get an offer for 2 (at least I wasted their time, recruiter + 4 interviews dragged on for a month)

I withdrew from another one 2 days before my full day onsite (was supposed to be 4 1-hour technical/coding interviews, + a lunch ""interview"" with a manager). I hope I got their schedules in flux. I only did this because I didn't want to spend 3+ hours driving, paying for parking, and taking a day of PTO to ""pwn these RTOtards""

I got offers for 3

but I turned them all down saying that I changed my mind, I have decided to stay in current role and would only consider leaving for something fully remote or within a <20 minute commute. For each, I said I'd be open to doing 1 day a week

Each interview process lasted a month+. Factor in a recruiter call, then initial 1 hr phone screen with an eingeer, then at least 4-5 hour long interviews with more engineers/managers or a full day onsite. That's a lot of man hours wasted and time stringing them along. Imagine if a company was interviewing candidates, only for 75% of them to reject based on WFH/commute, and now a month has gone by

Fast forward to today where I work from my spare bedroom/home office. It's rare that I'm in anything more than shorts or sweats. Some days I have shoes on, but most days I don't.

Returning to Office and Becoming Lazy Employee,"So if you want to quit with RTO but don’t want to miss out on unemployment - what if you turn into a Homer Simpson when you show up to work? Just a lazy slob that gets nothing done.

The hidden cost of hybrid and in-person work: why fully remote is a game changer,"This is going to be a fun read, I promise. 🍿

Let’s talk about what I call the “telenovela principle”. I’m not a cognitive scientist, and these ideas come purely from observation and experience. But if you’ve ever been caught up in a telenovela or a long-running series, you’ll know the feeling: the intricate power plays, the unspoken hierarchies, the rituals of dominance, and the subtle tensions that keep the drama alive. Even if you step away for a while, the moment you return, you’re right back in it, and you are *part* of it, immediately recalling the dynamics, decoding glances, and anticipating the next twist.

The office works the same way. When you’re in person, even part-time, you’re a participant in this ongoing story. There’s always a “big monkey” asserting dominance, the boss who commands unspoken rituals of loyalty, like requiring everyone to laugh at their jokes or adjust their tone in their presence. There are the everyday performers, like the colleague who thrives on adoration or the gatekeeper who silently enforces invisible rules. These aren’t written in any handbook, but they exist, and they require your mental energy to navigate. You find yourself noticing the power struggles, the alliances forming in hushed conversations, and the subtle gestures signaling favor or disapproval. It’s an endless stream of social processing, often unrelated to the actual work.

Hybrid work doesn’t escape this dynamic. Each time you enter the office, it’s like pressing play on a paused series. You have to catch up on the latest storylines: who’s climbing the ladder, who’s fallen out of favor, what new rituals or hierarchies have taken shape. The telenovela is still there, waiting for you, demanding the same mental energy to re-engage with the social mechanics. Hybrid work doesn’t simplify the drama at all; it just makes it episodic, reinforcing the need to tune back into the plot every time you return.

Fully remote work eliminates this layer of complexity. The drama loses its stage when everyone is behind a screen. Without the proximity to assert dominance or build unspoken hierarchies, the focus shifts to what truly matters: the work itself. While remote collaboration still involves interaction, it’s more task-oriented and far less emotionally draining. It spares you from the subtle politics, the rituals of adoration, and the constant recalibration that in-person work demands. The absence of this unnecessary “story” frees up your mental space, allowing you to focus on your creativity, productivity, and actual goals. It’s no wonder that some “big personalities” resist remote work: it removes the tools they depend on to thrive in this unspoken telenovela. 
Remote work frees us to skip the BS, so to let the big personalities cling to their shenanigans, leaving the drama to the TV.",RevolutionStill4284,2025-01-06 15:46:09,990,remotework
accidentally sighed unmuted on a teams meeting as a new hire,"I feel so bad lol.

I let out a loud, audible sigh. No one mentioned it, but I quickly realized I forgot to put myself on mute and muted myself.

Girlfriend expects me to be at her beck and call working remotely,I work great from home. I can focus well and get all my work done. But when she tries to get me to drive her places during the day she insists that I ‘stay over’ at her aunts’/family house and do work from there and not return home. I say no because I tell her there is a boundary for me when it comes to when and where I will work. She guilts me into going and brings up how she is not happy when I say no to things that make her happy. I insist that it’s not healthy for her to have her way all the time and voice to her that I resent her for putting this pressure on me. I end up going most of the time (like right now at her family house where I don’t have fuck all for monitors) and I am fucking miserable. I can’t attend any meetings and do productive work to get into a flow state. I am career driven and she is not.

Company went fully RTO,"Company I worked for was fully WFH. People within my team work all over. I have a co-worker who works from Florida. My supervisor works fully remote from Kentucky despite there being an office nearby.

Back in August I informed my supervisor that by the end of the year I’ll be moving to NYC. My supervisor said it was fine and to inform him when I find a place so we can update my taxes.
Then In September we received a random email from the CEO informing everyone that we will be RTO. He mentions in the email some study on how working from the office is beneficial for growth and employee satisfaction. Nobody really put up much of a fight. Although I found it weird how only in my state did they inform this. I know this because my supervisor lives by a HQ in Kentucky  and works fully remote. I have a co-worker who works with the Texas team so he’s fully remote. And he informed me that another one of his co-workers was approved to move to Florida and wfh.

When we returned to office it was really weird. The emails leading up to the return to office was filled with how managers will be setting up more one on ones and there will be collaborations between supervisors managers and analyst. I never saw this. I never saw my manager or anyone in my team. Nobody checked up on me besides my supervisor who lives in Kentucky and would occasionally zoom call me. This went on until December when I contacted my supervisor because I found a place in nyc like we spoke.

“Are you thinking of commuting back to Baltimore to work in office?” Which I replied laughing saying no.I then follow up and ask if I can wfh out in New York. Which my manager says “I’ll pass this by the higher ups but I doubt they will approve it unless you commute to an office in jersey or midtown.” Which I then said I wouldn’t mind doing that. He then said he was gonna let me know what they say when they have their meeting. The following day my manager says that my request was denied and they denied it because they think that it’s beneficial for me to work with my team here in Baltimore and it’s beneficial for trainings and what not. I found this to be so ridiculous because none of that already occurs despite us already working in office for a couple months. I put my two weeks in and my manager lastly says “it’s okay we’re already interviewing a lot of new people so don’t feel bad leaving”",Goldensweatshirt,2024-01-28 16:03:18,947,remotework

"Well, first full day back at the office in three years . . .","Well, first full day back to the office after working remotely for three years. I’d been routinely coming in for staff meetings etc. but before the holidays my boss imposed a mandatory back to office requirement, despite the fact that my sales job is entirely portable (able to be done online, from anywhere).  

He and I had agreed to an indefinite remote-work situation in 2021 on account of my great performance working remotely in 2020 (all my numbers went way up, and stayed up since then). I agreed to give up my office then, without issue, but have since been given a new office of equal size. 

I asked my boss why he was mandating back to office for me and he simply said that he felt that some of my colleagues really thrive in an office setting - despite the fact that I don’t (per our previous discussion and agreement, and my good performance with remote work) - and it was easier for him to manage people “in person”.

So, I’m sitting here feeling pretty irritated - like I should’ve fought harder to maintain the remote work agreement we established years ago, and that I’ve totally lost my leverage in an effort to be a “team player”.

This back to work mandate feels arbitrary, even punitive.  I have a portable revenue generating job, demonstrated high-level performance working remotely, and there’s no advantage to my organization in my being at the office. My work is 99% outward/customer facing, I don’t have a team here, and my work doesn’t require interaction with colleagues (no brainstorming sessions or “team building” activities).

"Walmart Demands Remote Workers Relocate for 'In-Person Culture', Then Asks Arkansas Employees to Work Remotely After Tornadoes Hit","Last month, Walmart announced layoffs and the closure of 51 Health Clinics across the United States. Employees in the Health & Wellness division, initially reassured of their job security, faced another blow just two weeks later:

A majority of Walmart's full-time remote employees received notice this month to relocate to Arkansas or accept severance (if eligible). Concurrently, several hundred other corporate workers across North America received layoff notices without the option to relocate. A smaller number of employees were given the choice to move to remaining offices in the San Francisco Bay, New York, and New Jersey areas. Notably, these offers are based on role and business needs rather than employee proximity to existing offices, resulting in some workers being asked to relocate across the country despite living near a Walmart office. Additionally, if two workers living in the same household receive relocation notices to different offices, the location for the more ""senior"" role will take precedence.

The reason provided for the latest changes? ""Walmart is an in-person culture,"" and they want workers reporting to the office five days a week...(**edit: primarily in Northwest Arkansas**).

This decision came despite the significant contributions of remote workers who helped the company navigate the pandemic, forge new ways of working, and achieve record profits. Walmart's latest financial report, released just days after the second round of layoff and relocation notices, showed profits of over $5 billion.

Ironically, after sending the in-person work mandate, a series of deadly tornadoes struck northwest Arkansas this Memorial Day weekend, causing widespread damage and power outages that affected Walmart's Home Office and many employees in the surrounding areas. In response, Walmart asked its Arkansas employees to work remotely for now...

**---**  
**Edit**: I apologize if my initial post is too nuanced. I appreciate all the perspectives shared here.

The irony I see here is multifaceted. The overall timing of events:

* underscores the need to **support adaptability in working styles**, not criticize and deprioritize them
* sadly exposes the reality of natural disasters overlooked by the fantasy life/culture narrative the company is pushing on workers **(most recently, to a mass workforce across the continent just two weeks ago)**
* shows the hypocrisy of the company's previous **praise of remote work during emergencies**, their **abrupt shift to devalue it**, and their subsequent need to **rely on it again after an emergency**
* emphasizes an ""**in-person culture**"" while a significant portion of their revenue and growth comes from **online sales** that is supported by remote networks
* **promotes digital transformation** to its millions of customers (who also make up their workforce), **but resists it internally**

I feel deeply for those affected by all of these events. Losing your home or loved ones, losing your livelihood, facing relocation demands that prioritize the company after having already uprooted/adapted your life and families to support the company's previous remote work demands...it's all devastating.

In addition, the NW Arkansas employees being expected to navigate difficult conditions after the storms, scrambling to find friends or businesses with working internet and power so they can report to the office remotely is a whole separate concern but still very relevant.

**""Prioritize your work commitments above your individual needs""** seems like the real ""**in-person culture**"" they're pushing here.",circlebacklater,2024-05-29 07:45:48,836,remotework
RTO and the ‘boil the frog’ strategy ,"TLDR 
The ""boil the frog"" metaphor refers to the idea that if you put a frog in boiling water, it will jump out, but if you put it in cold water and slowly heat it up, the frog will stay and be boiled alive. This explains why RTO initiatives have been happening gradually. This slow, gradual approach to returning to the office is a way for companies to try to “regain control and oversight” over their employees slowly but steadily.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-former-hr-chief-says-090000541.html

This approach is actually nothing new. In 2022, Adams (the NYC mayor) said “Let's start out with a three-day workweek, to let people see how safe it is to come back to work, then we cycle back into a five-day week”

The simple reason remote work will win,"Every human system we can think of is built on top of shared beliefs. Where those shared beliefs are deeply questioned by the majority, every system wobbles, shakes, finally dies out.

The office-centric economy is a system. In 2019, very few (including me) were questioning it. It was the way of life we dealt with since the beginning of our careers. Ergo, the system was solidly standing in place.

Then, the pandemic came, and people first started missing office life, to then start questioning office life, more and more.

Now, RTO mandates are being issued, but people aren’t generally buying in, except for a minority. They’re questioning the foundations of RTO itself, and a lot. They’re seeing its flaws. They’re loathing commutes and cubicles.

It won’t be apparent immediately, but any RTO initiative is destined to be an intrinsic failure, due to so many people calling BS on it.

It’s just a question of when, rather than if, offices will die out as the preferred way of conducting business for remote-capable jobs.

There’s no going back when minds deeply change. Systems need supporters, not detractors and questioners. There aren’t enough of the first. There are too few believers left.",RevolutionStill4284,2024-02-02 19:32:35,822,remotework

Remote work changed my life and it’s all because of the pandemic,"Hi all! Does anyone secretly feel a teensy bit grateful that the pandemic happened because before it the possibility of remote work in your field was slim to none?

Before COVID I worked in a hospital coordinating with clinic staff to consent patients to a research study. When the pandemic hit, I thought for sure I would be out of a job, but within six months we found a way to contact and consent patients remotely. Three years later, our team is still full time remote. 

Transitioning from being surrounded by people 24/7 to being in my cozy home environment has quite literally changed my life. The flexibility of my hours and lack of commute has allowed me to start almost every morning with a workout, make myself a big beautiful breakfast, spend time with my animals and family, and go for walks in the sunshine on my lunch break every day. In short, my work-life balance has never been better and neither has my mental health. I can still remember the many, many days of crying in clinic bathrooms because I was so overwhelmed by being surrounded by people and having no time for the things I value most.

Remote work will come back in full swing once the Quademic hits with full force,"Not sure if you guys have been keeping up with the news, but there’s a “quademic” brewing in the US and UK with the number of cases increasing since November.

Yes, you can probably design an office according to theory Y, but any form of forced attendance reverts to theory X by default anyway.

Theory X management is all about strict supervision and control, which is why traditional office settings fit this mold perfectly. Offices are synonymous with rigid schedules and constant monitoring. On the flip side, Theory Y management promotes trust, autonomy, and intrinsic motivation, making remote work, not a rededigned office, an ideal match.",RevolutionStill4284,2024-06-08 13:48:15,748,remotework

I left my high paying pharmacy job for a low pay wfh callcenter job,"I still lie to everyone and tell them I wfh as a pharmacy Technician but in reality I demoted myself to no more then a at home call center job. 
And I'm happy. I feel guilty but I'm happy. I love the mundane world of repeatedly reading a script I enjoy being a big fish in a small pond. The job I work u don't need a hs education or even a degree, just read the script verbatim done.
It's peaceful as I can read pretty fast and memorize fast so within the first month the script was downloaded into my heart.
I love also wfh and the fact I can spend morning with my daughter and talk to my sister on my lunch break, walk to my kitchen and play with my cats.
I enjoy watching k dramas while I work as well.
It's a weird feeling my whole life my parents pushed and pushed me to be something to graduate college and work a ""big job"" (bank, medical, law) and in a way I felt behind even when I became a pharmacy Technician I still felt well next step I must become a pharmacist.

But when I quit the job from stress. And got hired at this wfh job I kept thinking it should only be temporary then I'll do something more important.

But I'm happy
. I've worked here a year and I'm happy. Customers call and they are very nice to me and always say how I'm the best person they talked to. Most jobs I get yelled at or become insecure but here I fit in and am considered exceptional.

I also feel a bit guilty, I know I could do more then read a script and get a job that makes more money. But I don't want to be stressed anymore and I hate I lie about this job to my parents I wish I could be proud of it, I am proud of it. But I feel everyone will look down on me and keep thinking I should be doing better or get a higher level job.

"Why Everyone Should Cheer for Remote Work, Even If You Punch In On-Site","Here’s the deal:

- Traffic’s a Nightmare, Right? More folks working from home means fewer cars jamming up the roads. Less traffic equals fewer accidents and a smoother ride for everyone.
- Hunting for Parking Sucks: With less people driving to work, finding a parking spot won’t feel like the Hunger Games.
- Delays Be Gone: buses on time more often thanks to less traffic 
- Breath of Fresh Air: With fewer cars on the road, we’re not just cutting down on noise pollution but also slashing the amount of noxious gases choking up our air. This means a significant bump in air quality, making those deep, city breaths a lot less toxic.
- Healthier, Happier Cities: Embracing remote work could mean not just cleaner air but also fewer sick days for all. With less crowding on public transport and in offices, we're giving contagious diseases fewer chances to spread. Remember COVID?
- Local Love, Global Work: By rooting for remote work, we're supporting an economy where spending isn't confined to city centers. It's a shift that promises to rejuvenate neighborhood businesses, as remote workers distribute their dollars closer to home, breathing new life into local markets.

Bottom Line:

If you can’t work from home, you should still be all for remote work. Less hassle getting to work, and quicker rides. Plus, driving without playing dodge-the-idiot? Priceless. Remote work’s making everyone’s day a bit easier, even if your office is still your second home.",RevolutionStill4284,2024-02-10 17:31:26,700,remotework

What I love about working from home,"Woke up an hour later than I would in a previous life

Dropped the kids to school. Came straight back home. No need to pay “extra” for extended hours to drop them early so I can still go to work at “normal” hours. The time passed from getting in the car to drop off at school to getting back home was 10 mins. No hour+ commute to sit through

Ate fresh breakfast

Started the washer

Went to the gym

Came home, switched clothes to the dryer

Edit: Work day starts here!

Ate early lunch and worked for a few hours.. edit: I work through lunch normally.

Was in-between meetings but too short of time to get back in to a “work” flow so my wife and I put up laundry. Sometimes this will be us cleaning the house instead (this was 15 mins to put up laundry between the two of us)

Worked some more

In between meetings, went and got my daughter at normal pickup so she could do her homework early (3:20 they’re out) so she could get more time in her evening to herself (10 mins to get her, school is literally next to us)

Threw some food in the instant pot for meal prep (20 mins)

Back to work to finish out the day 

And for dinner we’re starting it before I’m off. “After work” and the evening truly belongs to us with WFH

Weekends: pure leisure, don’t do jack shit, because we did it during the week during work

Dell just enforced 100%RTO and I'm remote and feel I will be laid off. What do I do?,"Hello, I have worked for Dell for 6 years. Before Covid, we always had 2 days a week WFH, but they are getting rid of even that. Now it's 5 days mandatory, which is really shocking. I expected Dell to go to pre covid policies atleast. 

Anyways, I'm a remote employee, I gave up the ability to get a promotion or raise to stsy remote but unfortunately the cost of living is superseeding my once more than plentiful paycheck. And I feel that Dell will be laying me off because I am remote. 

I enjoy working remote, it's better for my focus and I always got more done because I don't have distractions at home. I want to continue remote work but I'm not sure where to go if Dell lays me off. Where have others gone after Dell that has worked for them with better pay and Remote policies?

I work a sales role with some low level OT help desk knowledge.  I have a side business after hours detailing jets but I'm curious what other options are out there.

Shutting down the ‘remote work was never supposed to last’ argument,"The claim that “remote work was never supposed to be a permanent concession” falls apart when you dig into how companies actually handled it. 

Plenty of them leaned hard into remote setups or brought on fully remote employees without ever spelling out that it was temporary, only to pull a fast one later by forcing everyone back.

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/culture-key-hybrid-work-michael-dell

Others kept things murky on purpose, dodging tough conversations until the economy tanked and employees couldn’t push back as easily. That kind of move screams opportunism to me, not leadership. 

On top of that, companies often play favorites, letting top execs and star employees sidestep the rules while the rest of the workforce is told to suck it up. 

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pays-work-remotely-only-youre-new-starbucks-ceo-ryan-serhant-rq1ce

They also brush aside clear evidence that remote work gets the job done, trotting out tired excuses about “culture” while pushing policies that go against their own green goals by shoving people back into long commutes. Add in the fact that employees are stuck footing the bill for gas, transit, or whatever else comes with being back in the office, and it’s clear these mandates are not about teamwork but control and real estate.

"Hybrid work is not the future, says Meta’s former director of remote work: It’s an ‘illusion of choice’","She gets is 100%



“Hybrid is an illusion of choice,” Dean tells Fortune. Mandatory office attendance, which Dean calls “the crux” of hybrid plans, is more sinister than it looks, and most workers don’t acknowledge how central they are. By mandating any amount of time in the office, companies remove many potential benefits for the employee “and much of the benefit for the company.”

(...)

On the other hand, enforcing even just one day in-person per week “requires people to organize their life around the office, and companies have to pay the highest cost of real estate,” Dean says. “It means you’re carrying all the costs of the old model, and can’t have any efficiencies of the new model.”

(...)

Plus, she adds, the office is never going to be a solution to existing problems of productivity, innovation, or creativity. “Those are all how to work problems, not where to work problems,” she says. “The office won’t solve these problems. New ways of working will.

Because of the hole, she stopped eating completely and requires a feeding tube. None of the daycares in our area will take her because they aren't equipped to handle her needs (if she pulls her tube out, how to work her feeding pump, the supplies that go with it, etc). Therefore, I had to hire a home nurse to take care of her. If I'm forced to return to office, I'd have to quit because the nurse cannot come without a parent present.

Requiring Zoom cameras be on… outside of meetings?,"My company has been going crazy with this ever since covid and has never had a similar policy to this before 2020. 


We are required to log into zoom, enter a 24/7 “meeting” that never ends because our company is 24/7. we are separated into breakout rooms by ourselves and there is 1 room for every employee. Their reasoning is that we “must be readily available to respond at all times, in case a supervisor or manager needs to speak with you.”


We must keep cameras on with face visible at all times. We must be sharing our screen and audio with microphones unmuted. We are not allowed to cover, turn off, or be away from the camera even if there is nobody in the meeting with us. (someone in management found a way to view everybody without joining the breakout room, so even if it doesn’t LOOK like you’re visible, you might be.)


The reason this is so absurd to me is that it doesn’t stop at us remote workers. we have several offices and every single employee is expected to comply except management. 


is this legal? it’s a fireable offense. i know it’s not illegal to require it during a meeting, but to require it OUTSIDE of a meeting? this is ridiculous. 


Edit To Add: I apologize if i did not communicate things clearly, but i feel like i need to clarify. the “meeting” is 24/7 and never ends as we are a 24/7 call center. we are only required to comply with all of the above rulings during our 8 hour shift.

I should also add  that “readily available at all times” means “readily available to immediately respond at any moment of your shift.” Although our boss has been known to contact people on our personal phones outside of our shift hours to request that we immediately clock in for overtime.

We are not under literal individual 24/7 surveillance. just our 8 hours, not including restroom and lunch (unless you eat in front of your computer, i guess?) and im sorry if i worded it as such.

multiple people have asked about bathroom breaks or lunch breaks. they can’t stop us, since it’s our own home, but we have to inform (in a company forum where it’s visible to all employees) why we’re leaving and inform them when we return.

it’s not uncommon to see messages like “going to rr. brb.” or “shift ending. good night, all.” or “going to lunch.” and similar messages popping in all day.

if management is looking for you and you happen to be away, or if they notice you logging out with no explanation, they WILL contact you about it and ask why you didn’t tell them you were leaving.

it’s worse in the office. you have to ask permission to use the restroom, go to lunch, and end your shift. if it’s busy, they actually will deny you leaving and if you leave anyway, stating you have an emergency, they have been known to write people up for it.

Even since I started working from home it’s been impossible to stop scrolling social media, absolutely killing my productivity. While I was in the office I sat next to my boss so that kept me very accountable. Now a whole day can go by and I feel like I got nothing done.

I also just want to spend less time on my phone in general. Does anyone have any ideas on how to escape the phone vortex?",DwaywelayTOP,2023-10-01 13:07:35,644,workfromhome

Would you take $15k less/year for WFH?,"I make $70K in office 5 days a week with a 1 hr commute each way. Toxic work environment and unnecessarily high stress. 

I have a job offer from a much lower stress position, completely remote for $55k. 

Background: I am not the breadwinner of my household. My income basically pays for my car and some groceries and savings. I am a mom of school aged children and am also in grad school online. 

Would you do it?

I don't see any value in interacting with coworkers face to face,"The ""building rapport"" and ""collaboration"" arguments for in-office work don't make any sense to me.  Coworkers aren't friends.  Playing office politics with my coworkers doesn't help me get the job done.  In fact, it's just a distraction.  

Putting up with the small talk, the gossip, the complaining, the moods, the attitudes, and the personality conflicts that are part of working in an office environment just lower morale and make me less productive.   

Remote work is straight forward and so much less stressful.  Just do what needs to be done without dealing with all of the people-related BS.  To me, that is the best part of working remotely.  ",stanerd,2024-11-11 16:54:03,624,remotework

Employees will not “end” fully remote work,"I came across this article and I disagree with its conclusions.

https://www.newsweek.com/remote-jobs-disappearing-2024-work-home-1870014

The claim that employees will spontaneously “decide” to “end the age of fully remote work” and will tolerate again the commute and noisy cubicle nonsense just because they “miss the social component” is in my view questionable, based on the outcomes of experiments like this:

TLDR: I totally believe fully remote work will prevail, not recede

"Remote Work is the Real MVP, Not AI","Look, I know AI is the hot thing right now, but can we talk about how remote work has literally saved more lives than any ChatGPT could? No more wasting 2 hours of your life stuck in traffic. No more missing your kid's soccer games. People can actually live in affordable places instead of cramming into overpriced apartments near the office.

Like, my friend just moved back to his hometown and kept his big city salary - that was impossible before. And parents can actually, you know, parent. When you think about it, this whole WFH revolution has probably done more for people's quality of life than any other tech change in recent memory.

Anyone else feel this way? How has remote work changed your game?",No_Material_5208,2024-11-13 06:09:38,608,remotework
I feel so much better working remote... Life is wonderful,"I've spent my whole working life feeling a square peg in a round hole. I'm far from reclusive but leaving my house every morning for 8-10 hours left me burned out every single time. I have mental health and other issues that make it truly challenging. 


I'm only 2 days/week in office at my new job and it's great. Usually the days I have to go in are fun and exciting with a variety of non desk based tasks and interactions with some really great colleagues. My WFH days I get to take it easy doing my administrative work. It's a good balance that evens out my more agoraphobic tendencies. 


I've been at my job for about 5 months and I am still incredibly thankful I found this job, for a lot of reasons, but remote work has simply enabled me to live a better, more functional life. I have never gone this long without calling in sick because I simply couldn't bring myself to go in that day. It was always my biggest weakness as an employee and now I am doing just fine. 


The only downside is, I don't think I can ever go back! I can only ever see myself seeking opportunities that allow me to WFH at least 60% of the time. I just can't believe I used to be expected to go to the office every single day, unnecessarily. Never again. ",LastArmistice,2025-01-26 01:48:02,603,remotework

"Pains me to say, but I think I’m ready to go back to the office","I’ve been working from home for almost two years now, and I loved it! I love the flexibility and freedom that comes with WFH, but no one really talks its downsides. 

I literally work from my bed. Now that I think about it, I spend most of my time nowadays in my bed, I socialize with no one, let alone go outside, and I feel like my life has no structure. Working from home full time has had a negative impact on my mental and physical health too. 

I’m looking for hybrid roles currently, I don’t want to be fully on-site, but I’d like to work around people and go outside some of the time.
